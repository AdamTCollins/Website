# Website
This website was created for a college assignment which required a team of four to publish a non-profit and voluntary charity website.
As a team, we decided our good cause to make the earth a better place was to make oceans, seas or rivers a cleaner and safer to live place.
We met up frequenty to work on our website, building relationships and improving team chemistry with every session.
I personally believe it was these frequent meetings that cause such smooth sailing for us as a team.
This website was a great learning experience for us all as we had only covered the very basics of HTML in our module, and barely any CSS.
Overall, I think this project assisted us all by developing our communication, coding and teamwork skills.
